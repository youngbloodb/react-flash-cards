    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the Control Unit?",
      "answer": "A defined, physically separated unit that coordinates operations of the other units of a computer; sends control signals to other units and registers their states",

      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is ASCII?",
      "answer": "the American Standard Code for Information Interchange; text code standard for conversion of numbers, letters and symbols into binary code; letters and symbols are converted into decimal equivalents and then converted to binary code format.",
      "topic": "Transition to CS 1 - Lecture 1"
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is computer memory?",
      "answer": "computer hardware with integrated circuits used to store information; programs and data are usually stored in memory and accessed during processing",
